# Plate Number Recognition (PNR)
## Intorduction to PNR
The main implement of PNR is __`image segmentation`__ and __`feature extraction`__, **`pattern recognition`**, and two main pattern 
recgonition algorithm **`Support Vector Machine`** and 
**`Artificial Neural Networks`**.

The two main parts of PNR are
* Plate detction
* Plate recognition
